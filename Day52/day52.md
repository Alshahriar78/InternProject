# 🚀 Day 52 – Spring Data JPA Deep Dive 🔍

Today, I focused on mastering advanced concepts in **Spring Data JPA** with practical examples. Below is a complete summary of all topics covered and understood.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

| ✅ Task | Topic |
|--------|-------|
| 1️⃣ | `@Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.SINGLE_TABLE)` |
| 2️⃣ | `@Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.JOINED)` |
| 3️⃣ | `@Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.TABLE_PER_CLASS)` |
| 4️⃣ | **Polymorphic Queries** |
| 5️⃣ | `@Embeddable` & `@Embedded` Entities |
| 6️⃣ | `implements Serializable` in JPA classes |
| 7️⃣ | **Derived Queries** (`findBy`, `findAllBy`, etc.) |
| 8️⃣ | `findAllBy...` Usage and Comparison |
| 9️⃣ | **Playing with `findBy` Methods** (rich examples with real-life fields) |
| 🔟 | Java Faker Dependency (for generating test data) |
| 1️⃣1️⃣ | `@Modifying` and custom update queries |
| 1️⃣2️⃣ | `@NamedQuery` (predefined queries in entities) |
| 1️⃣3️⃣ | `JpaSpecificationExecutor` and dynamic criteria-based queries |

## 🧠 Skills Strengthened

- Deep understanding of **JPA Inheritance strategies** with real use-cases
- Practical use of `@Modifying` and `@Query` for updates
- Created **dynamic filter logic** with `JpaSpecificationExecutor`
- Used **Java Faker** for fake data generation
- Mastered multiple **Derived Query** patterns
- Clear grasp of **Embeddable objects** and reuse via composition
